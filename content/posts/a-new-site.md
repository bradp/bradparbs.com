After a few years of barely changing anything on my site, I'm super happy to finally build **a whole new site**! ðŸŽ‰

This site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) & [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). It's been super fun to build, and I'm excited to finally get back to writing some blog posts.

I've recently been updating a few of my other sites, and it feels good to use some sleek new tools to do it.
