I’m currently a Developer at [Awesome Motive](https://awesomemotive.com/), where I am building the easiest WordPress form plugin: [WPForms](https://wpforms.com/).

I like to [build things](/projects/) on the internet.

I’m a WordPress fanatic. I’ve contributed to WordPress Core, have built a variety of custom plugins & themes, as well as a variety of tools and guides.

I have spoken at WordCamps across the United States, as well as many local meetups in Milwaukee and Chicago. I have spoken on a [variety of subjects](httpsasdf://bradparbs.com/projects/#talks--slides). Among those are Local Development, Building WordPress Plugins, Using the Command Line, WordPress Development, Responsive Web Design, Version Control, and more.
