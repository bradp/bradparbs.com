You have a site you want to work on, so you connect with FTP, download a file, modify it, upload it back up, and then refresh the page to see if your changes worked.

No matter how fast your code is, if your server itself isn’t running to it’s maximum performance, you’re not delivering your site as fast as you could be. By setting up Nginx and the new HHVM , you can get your server delivering fully loaded pages faster than most servers answer a request.
HHVM is an open-source virtual machine designed for executing programs written in Hackand PHP.</description></item></channel></rss>
