      <description>After a few years of barely changing anything on my site, I&amp;rsquo;m super happy to finally build a whole new site! ðŸŽ‰
This site is powered by Hugo &amp;amp; Tailwind CSS. It&amp;rsquo;s been super fun to build, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to finally get back to writing some blog posts.
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been updating a few of my other sites, and it feels good to use some sleek new tools to do it.</description>

      <description>As someone who loves the command line, Iâ€™m always striving to make my workflow easier, more efficient, and just overall better.

      <description>When I started doing web development, I think I started the way a lot of us did. You have a site you want to work on, so you connect with FTP, download a file, modify it, upload it back up, and then refresh the page to see if your changes worked. This process doesnâ€™t really work when youâ€™re working with a team of people, or on a site that people are actively going to.</description>

      <description>One of the most enjoyable parts about writing code is writing efficient andÂ performant functionality. No matter how fast your code is, if your server itself isnâ€™t running to itâ€™s maximum performance, youâ€™re not delivering your site as fast as you could be. By setting up NginxÂ and the new HHVM, you can get your server delivering fully loaded pages faster than most servers answer a request.
HHVM is an open-source virtual machine designed for executing programs written in Hackand PHP.</description>
