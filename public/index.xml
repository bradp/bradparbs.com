This site is powered by Hugo &amp;amp; Tailwind CSS. It&amp;rsquo;s been super fun to build, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to finally get back to writing some blog posts.
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been updating a few of my other sites, and it feels good to use some sleek new tools to do it.</description></item><item><title>About Brad Parbs</title><link>https://bradparbs.com/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bradparbs.com/about/</guid><description>I’m currently a Developer at Awesome Motive, where I am helping to build the easiest WordPress form plugin: WPForms.

You have a site you want to work on, so you connect with FTP, download a file, modify it, upload it back up, and then refresh the page to see if your changes worked. This process doesn’t really work when you’re working with a team of people, or on a site that people are actively going to.</description></item><item><title>Setting up WordPress + Nginx + HHVM For The Fastest Possible Load Times</title><link>https://bradparbs.com/2014/setting-up-wordpress-nginx-hhvm-for-the-fastest-possible-load-times/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://bradparbs.com/2014/setting-up-wordpress-nginx-hhvm-for-the-fastest-possible-load-times/</guid><description>One of the most enjoyable parts about writing code is writing efficient and performant functionality. No matter how fast your code is, if your server itself isn’t running to it’s maximum performance, you’re not delivering your site as fast as you could be. By setting up Nginx and the new HHVM, you can get your server delivering fully loaded pages faster than most servers answer a request.
HHVM is an open-source virtual machine designed for executing programs written in Hackand PHP.</description></item></channel></rss>
