This site is powered by Hugo &amp;amp; Tailwind CSS . It&amp;rsquo;s been super fun to build, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to finally get back to writing some blog posts.
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been updating a few of my other sites, and it feels good to use some sleek new tools to do it.</description></item><item><title>A Beginner’s Guide to the Best Command Line Tools</title><link>https://bradparbs.com/blog/2015/06/a-beginners-guide-to-the-best-command-line-tools/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://bradparbs.com/blog/2015/06/a-beginners-guide-to-the-best-command-line-tools/</guid><description>As someone who loves the command line, I’m always striving to make my workflow easier, more efficient, and just overall better.

You have a site you want to work on, so you connect with FTP, download a file, modify it, upload it back up, and then refresh the page to see if your changes worked.

No matter how fast your code is, if your server itself isn’t running to it’s maximum performance, you’re not delivering your site as fast as you could be. By setting up Nginx and the new HHVM , you can get your server delivering fully loaded pages faster than most servers answer a request.
HHVM is an open-source virtual machine designed for executing programs written in Hackand PHP.</description></item><item><title>About Brad Parbs</title><link>https://bradparbs.com/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bradparbs.com/about/</guid><description>Brad Parbs is a Milwaukee-based WordPress developer &amp; engineer, focusing on high perfomance, user friendly, enterprise scale, API driven websites &amp; applications.
